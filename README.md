## Objective: 
In this activity, students will create a simple Model-View-Controller (MVC) application using C# programming to address Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #2: "Zero Hunger" <href>https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2</href>. The goal is to develop an application that helps manage agricultural data to support sustainable farming practices.

## Scenario:
Imagine you are part of a team working on a project to promote sustainable agriculture in your local community. Your task is to develop a C# MVC application that helps farmers keep track of their crop yields, expenses, and profits, with the aim of reducing food insecurity and promoting sustainable farming practices.

## Summary:
This activity not only allows you to know about the MVC architecture in C# but also encourages you to apply your programming skills to address real-world challenges related to sustainable agriculture and achieving SDG #2. You will gain hands-on experience in developing a practical application that supports a global goal. Make the UI as user friendly as possible but also following good design principles
